difference between String and StringBuilder :
1. object of string is immutable but object of stringBuilder are 
mutable.
2. we can create a string object without using new operator but
in string builder required new operator.
3. string builder is speedy and consumes less memory than a string while performing.
4. strings length is constant but string builders length are not specified
